        "name": "Thorin Oakenshield",
        "description": "Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet 'Oakenshield,' which remained with him even in death.",

        "description": "Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company. As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains. With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil. They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river.  At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain. Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five Armies, and all three were later buried with honor.",

Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.",

In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old. In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as 'simpletons' and also said that Hobbits 'would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell'.",

After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin. Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.",

His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen 'by some fifty years,' and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was 'the eldest left.' Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.",
